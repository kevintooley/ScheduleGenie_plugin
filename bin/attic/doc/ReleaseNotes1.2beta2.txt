New features in Release 1.2beta1

* You now can run multiple Rapla installations on one server by just creating more webapp-folders
* You can configure the column size of a text field
* GUI Pollishing. Replaced some icons. 
* There is a new plugin called archive. But at the moment you can only autodelete old events

Changes

* Custom communication layer was replaced with http protocol and xml communication.
  It is more robust and will causes less overhead on the server side.
* You can set a refresh interval for receiving the changes from other clients (Use a higher value if you have many concurrent access).
* Now we use piccolo as xml parser. Its a lot faster than aelfred
* Upgraded to new jetty version 5.11
* There is no more webapp version. The webapp is now part of the binary distribution
* You need a new version of nt-service for this version
