Big Changes since 0.12.4


The calendar stays on top
--------------------------

The left bar is no more. It is replaced by a context-sensitive Menubar.
Every click in the left tree affects the displayed events in the right pane

A click on the users shows reservations of the user
A click on the resource shows all reservations of the resource
A click on an event-type shows all reservations of an event-type

You can combine them. Clicking on a user, an event-type and a resource to show only
the reservations of the selected event-type, that are reserved by the selected user and allocate
the selected resource.

Sytem and User Configuration with menu
--------------------------------------

Configuration is possible through the menu. You can configure the
plugins and most  of the Rapla System through the following menus:
option or admin/option.

NEW Plugin API!
----------------

New powerfull plugin API. See the plugins in the source-distribution
and MyRapla module in CVS. Find an overview of all currently allowed extension points of the Rapla API at

http://rapla.sourceforge.net/doc/javadocs/org/rapla/plugin/RaplaExtensionPoints.html

A plugin HOWTO will soon be available in the wiki

New Views
------------
- new period-view (Swing and HTML)
- new table-view (replaces event view)

Other new features

- French translation of the plugins (even the period wizard)
- Custom Event and Resource coloring
- New plugin "Copy Periods" to copy the allocations from one period to another

- New Icons from the eclipse project were introduced
