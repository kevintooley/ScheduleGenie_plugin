Rapla Version 0.6 released on 26.8.2001


Changes and new Features

- Changing the name of a reservation is possible.
- Reservation names are now unique according to their semester.
- It is now possible to select start- and end-time in a ComboBox.
- A warning-dialog appears if you want to close the edit-window and there are non-saved changes.
- Printing is now supported (only tested under Windows). The class org.rapla.PrintTools can be used to
  print any AWT or Swing component. The component will be printed in
  high-resolution.
- On saving of the XML-file there should be a backup of the
  old data in data.xml.old
- Added some JUnit-tests. The test-cases are located in the test-src directory.
  To run all test cases (expect the DB-Ones) type
     build test-all (Windows)
     build.sh test-all (Unix)
   A test-build can be run before every commit to make the cvs version
   more stable.
- For convinience the ok-button is allways left and the abort-button allways right.


enhanced i18n support:

- The timezone of Rapla is set to GMT+00:00, by default. In future versions different 
  timezones will be supported, but for that we have to deal with some SQL-time-conversion problems.
- The data.xml file is now in english with language-sensitive resource-metadata.
- localization of times in the weekview ( 9 pm instead of 21:00)


Bugfixes (only some of them are listed here)

- 9:00 - 10:00 and 10:00 - 11:00 never create a conflict
- There is always a default-semester
- Title of warnings are localized
- language-change is possible before second login.
- refresh is possible after first logout.
- 5-10 typos corrected (thanks to Magnus)
